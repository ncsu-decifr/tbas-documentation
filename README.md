### Color editor
The purpose of the color editor is to allow the user to select preferred colors for the layout of the tree. When T-BAS creates a tree it randomly assigns colors to attributes from all colors in the spectrum. For each attribute, the rows in the legend are arranged by color so that the user can find the label of a color by looking in the legend. The colors can be changed in the color editor. However, the order of entries in the legend remains as for the original colors assigned. There is no limit to how many values or attributes can be edited.

To change the colors, click the color editor button and the color editor window will pop up.
