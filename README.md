### Color editor
The purpose of the color editor is to allow the user to select preferred colors for the layout of the tree. When T-BAS creates a tree it randomly assigns colors to attributes from all colors in the spectrum. For each attribute, the rows in the legend are arranged by color so that the user can find the label of a color by looking in the legend. The colors can be changed in the color editor. However, the order of entries in the legend remains as for the original colors assigned. There is no limit to how many values or attributes can be edited.

To change the colors, click the color editor button and the color editor window will pop up.

There are two ways to change the colors. Colors can be selected on the color bars or inputting a known hex color value.

To change the color using the HSL color bars, slide the center vertical black line (while holding down the left mouse button) on one of the 3 bars to the left or right. One or all three bars can be modified in order to display the desired color. The letter under the corresponding bar indicate the following: H (hue), S (saturation), L (lightness).
