Backbone constraint tree with bootstraps,RaxML method
Bifurcating tree,Tree where each node has 2 children
BLAST,Basic Local Alignment Search Tool&#44; used to match unknown sequences to known sequences in database
De novo phylogenetic analysis,RaxML method
EPA with likelihood weights,RaxML method that places sequence on edges of existing tree
FASTA,A file sequence format for unaligned data
Genetic distance cutoff,Value used by custom algorithm to exclude divergent species from placement
GTRCAT (Rate heterogeneity model),Faster model than GTRGAMMA that uses a different approximation to capture rate heterogeneity across sites
GTRGAMMA (Rate heterogeneity model),General Time Reversible (GTR) model with Gamma distributed rates across sites
ITS,Internal transcribed spacer locus
Labels: Display Names,Node-click context menu&#44; display leaf names in selected clade in large trees. Tree with greater than 2000 leaves do not display names for performance reasons.
Labels: Likelihood Weight,Node-click context menu&#44; click on leaf of EPA placement will show all leaves attached to the edge that gives 95% cumulative weight.
Ladderize tree,Sort tree leaves from deepest to shallowest or reverse
Locus (Loci),A location on a chromosome
LSU,Large subunit locus
MEP,Metadata Enhanced PhyloXML format that is a valid phyloXML with added tags for use in T-BAS and DeCIFR
Metadata: Download,Node-click context menu&#44; download data of selected according to selections in format and sequence
Metadata: View,Node-click context menu&#44; view data of selected according to selections in format and sequence in pop-up window
Multifurcating tree,Tree where each node can have multiple children
NEWICK,A standard for representing trees
NEXUS,A file format with multiple uses&#44; can contain trees and alignments
OTUs,A grouping of sequences into percent similarity
Outgroup,Leaves of a tree placed in a distinct clade&#44; used to root tree
PHYLIP,A file format for aligned sequence data
PhyloXML,XML language designed to describe phylogenetic trees (or networks) and associated data
Query sequences,Unaligned unknown sequence data
Rate heterogeneity model,A phylogenetic model that accounts for evolutionary rate heterogeneity
RAxML,Software tool used to place alignment on a tree&#44; plus some other utilities
Reference set,A set of tree&#44; alignments&#44; and metadata of known species at a specific taxonomic level used for placement
Taxa: Select All,Node-click context menu&#44; select all leaves on tree
Taxa: Select(unselect),Node-click context menu&#44; select or unselect all leafs in clade
Taxa: Unselect All,Node-click context menu&#44; unselect all leaves on tree
Tree: Collapse(expand),Node-click context menu&#44; collapse clade into a single node. Collapsed clade appears as a small circle. Click on this circle to restore clade.
Tree: Network (TCS),Node-click context menu&#44; create TCS network of all query strains in clade
Tree: Newick tree,Node-click context menu&#44; download newick tree of selected clade in either phylip or NEXUS format
Tree: Phylogeny (RaxML),Node-click context menu&#44; create de novo tree of selected clade
Tree: Pie Charts,Node-click context menu&#44; create pie charts to show relationships of selected attributes
Tree: Subtree (new window),Node-click context menu&#44; view subtree of selected clade in new window
Tree: Subtree(tree),Node-click context menu&#44; view subtree of selected clade
UNITE,Database of fungal ITS for BLAST
